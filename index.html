            <p>I’ve been using computers for literally as long as I can remember, 
                so computers and technology have always been second nature to me. I took a Web
                Development class in High School and received the best student award. 
                Additionally, I worked on our school’s journalism team as a photo editor,
                and our team won “Best Overall Yearbook Award” both years. My university
                education in Psychology and Business administration easily translate to 
                the technological emphasis in User Experience that I am striving to
                become a part of. After graduating college, I moved to Denver, CO. It
                was there that I realized I had the potential to become an excellent programmer.</p>
                
            <p>I started learning about JavaScript on my own using free
                web resources. Then I started taking classes at Red Rocks Community 
                College in HTML, CSS, and Python. I fell in love with it and it
                became even clearer that front end web development was my calling.
                Now I am attending Nashville Software School and couldn’t be
                happier about it. I feel confident that they are preparing us
                for our career. I’m looking for the proper balance of not only
                being grateful for the community and the moment but also 
                looking what the future will bring!</p>
