                    <article class="bout-me">
                    <p>I’ve been using computers for literally as long as I can remember, 
                        so computers and technology have always been second nature to me. I took a Web
                        Development class in High School and received the best student award. 
                        Additionally, I worked on our school’s journalism team as a photo editor,
                        and our team won “Best Overall Yearbook Award” both years. My university
                        education in Psychology and Business administration easily translate to 
                        the technological emphasis in User Experience that I am striving to
                        become a part of. After graduating college, I moved to Denver, CO. It
                        was there that I realized I had the potential to excel as a programmer.</p>
                        
                    <p>I started learning about JavaScript on my own using free
                        web resources. Then I started taking classes at Red Rocks Community 
                        College in HTML, CSS, and Python. I fell in love with it and it
                        became even clearer that front end web development was my calling.
                        Now I am nearing graduation at Nashville Software School and couldn’t be
                        happier about it. I feel beyond proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript including React
                        I’m looking for the proper balance of not only
                        being grateful for the community and the moment but also 
                        looking what the future will bring!</p>
