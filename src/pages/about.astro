        The Work
      </h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
        I do IT Support and SysAdmin work — the kind of job where something is always slightly on
        fire and you're equal parts problem-solver, translator between humans and machines, and
        occasional fire extinguisher. I genuinely like it.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        What I care about most in that space is optimization. Not in a "let me spend three weeks
        automating a five-minute task" way (okay, sometimes), but in the sense that systems
        should work well, processes shouldn't be painful, and there's usually a better way if
        you look for it.

        The Interests
      </h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Game design — not as a job (yet), but as a genuine fixation. I think about player
        motivation, feedback loops, what makes a system feel fair or rewarding, how rules create
        meaning. I play games partly to enjoy them and partly to take them apart and see how they
        work.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Fantasy sports: NFL and NHL, in that order of chaos. At some point "fun hobby" became
        "I have spreadsheets for this and I'm not apologizing."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Indie music — the kind that feels like it was made in a room, not a formula. I like
        things that sound like they cost the artist something to make.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Psychology, as a lens on everything else. It snuck into how I think about game design,
        how I approach support work, how I understand why people do what they do.
      </p>

        The Background
      </h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Psychology and Business degree. Nashville Software School alumni — I went through a
        full-stack bootcamp back in 2017, which is where I learned to build things on the web.
        That led to some dev work, which eventually wound into the IT and systems world where
        I've settled.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        I've lived in Nashville and Denver. Currently somewhere in between, depending on when
        you're reading this.
