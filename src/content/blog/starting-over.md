The old site was a portfolio from 2017. It had three projects on it — an NHL stats app, a game trading platform, and a free WiFi finder. All built during a bootcamp. All things I haven't touched in years.

That version of the site was trying to say "hire me." This one isn't.

I'm in IT now. SysAdmin, support, the whole deal. It's good work — the kind where something breaks and you fix it, where systems either run well or they don't, where the feedback loop is immediate. I like it.

But I think about other things too. Game design — like, genuinely think about it, in a way that probably crosses the line from hobby into mild obsession. Fantasy hockey and fantasy football in a way that has definitely crossed that line. Indie music. Psychology. Whatever I'm currently reading or playing or stuck on.

This site is where I write about that stuff. No particular schedule. No particular angle. Just thinking out loud in public.

If that sounds like something, come back sometime.
